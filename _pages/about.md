Hi there, I am Haodong Wen (温浩东), a first-year Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Kaifeng Lyu](https://kaifeng.ac/). I graduated from Xi'an Jiaotong University with honors from [Qian xuesen honors college](https://en.xjtu.edu.cn/2021-03/22/c_605250.htm).

During my undergraduate study, I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Kaifeng Lyu](https://kaifeng.ac/), [Prof.Yisen Wang](https://yisenwang.github.io/), [Prof.Deyu Meng](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/dymeng), and [Prof.Xiangyong Cao](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/caoxiangyong).

My long-term goal is to discover and explain the physical principles behind deep learning. To this end, I believe we need a tight combination of theory and practice: on the one hand, we should identify and summarize important real-world phenomena and problems; on the other hand, we should develop theoretical models that can explain or address them.

Recently, I’ve been particularly interested in scaling behaviors in large-model training and the training dynamics of neural networks.
